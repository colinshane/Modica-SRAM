% How do I determine the optimal circuit when I have several the following 
% * An input signal drives a chain of logic gates (INVs and NANDs)
% * The chain drives a phi modeled transmission line (SideLoad)
% * The far end of the transmission line drives another chain of logic gates
% * The end of the 2nd logic gate chain drives a second phi modeled 
%    transmission line (WordLine)
