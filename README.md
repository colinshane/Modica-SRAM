Modica-SRAM
===========

Design of a 32-kbit synchronous SRAM with 32-bit words, using 180 nm process technology.  

Developed MATLAB scripts to evaluate architectural trade-offs between performance (using logical effort analysis) and area usage; see the source code for the HSPICE decks and MATLAB scripts that are used during architectural trade-off evaluation, and characterization of inverters for different supply voltages (VDD) and temperatures.  

It also includes HSPICE decks for the characterization of the 6-transistor SRAM cell for different transistor ratios, and the SRAM read and write circuitry.  

Co-designed and co-developed the SRAM using schematic entry in Cadence Virtuoso.  

Performed functional and timing verification by simulating extracted SPICE netlist in NanoSim.
